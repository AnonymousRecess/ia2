# Java Interpreter

In this assignment, we were tasked with extending the scanner and parser of the first interpreter assignment to allow the specified grammar functionality provided by our professor. This newly introduced functionality includes if-then-else, while do, blocks, begin-end and read/write. The test cases needed to also be modified to utilize write for the output as well as test the newly introduced functions. This led to a total of 26 implementation tests. 

## Running the Tester

To run the tests for the interpreter:
- naviagate to inside the test folder
- run the following bash command $ ./run

## Running the Interpreter

To run the interpreter with a user supplied program:
- navigate to inside the ia2 folder
- run the following bash command $javac*.java
- run the following bash command $java Interpreter <program> (with <program> substituted with the user's program to parse)
